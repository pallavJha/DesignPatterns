/**
 * Here we begin the chapter of Singleton Design Pattern. We'll start by creating a Config Manager and afterwards we'll
 * try to find the problems in it's implementation.
 * <p>
 * The requirements for the Config manager are
 * <li>
 *     <ol>
 *         It should load the default properties for the system.
 *     </ol>
 *     <ol>
 *         It should support the updates for the properties and make the updates available.
 *     </ol>
 * </li>
