/**
 * This is the 2nd Stage in the Strategy design pattern series.
 * <br>
 * Once our base(or the ducks) is set we can proceed forward to solve problems.
 * <br>
 * <u>Problem:</u>
 * <br/>
 * As we know that the ducks can fly. So, implement that!
 * <br/>
 * <u>Solution(Not the actual one):</u>
 * <br/>
 * As all the ducks have got the wings so they can fly. There seems to be an
 * obvious solution to it then. Let's make a fly method inside the duck class
 * and all the other concrete ducks will be able to fly.
