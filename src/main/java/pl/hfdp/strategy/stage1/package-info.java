/**
 * The package contains the classes Duck, MallardDuck and RedHeadDuck.
 * <br>
 * It represents the stage1 of the process through which we'll be
 * learning Strategy design pattern.
 * <br>
 * In this package all the concrete duck implementation override the
 * {@link pl.hfdp.strategy.stage1.Duck#display()} method because all
 * the ducks appear differently. The other methods, {@link pl.hfdp.strategy.stage1.Duck#quack()}
 * and {@link pl.hfdp.strategy.stage1.Duck#swim()} are not overridden
 * because this behaviour remains the same throughout all the ducks.
